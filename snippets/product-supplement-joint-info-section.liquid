      <h2 class="title">How do your joints cushion themselves?</h2>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p class="description">Joints are cushioned by cartilage and fluids.<br>
        Cartilage is a smooth, strong, stretchy tissue that covers bones at a joint. It absorbs shock and reduces friction and wear as you move.<br>
        Synovial fluid is like an oil that surrounds and lubricates joints. It lets bones smoothly move against each other. It also nourishes cartilage.</p>
      <h3>How does Curalin and the Happy Joints help?</h3>
      <p>By supporting cartilage, synovial fluid, joint capsules, and by keeping inflammation in check.<br>
        Combined, the supplements in the Happy Joints Bundle in addition to the ingredients in Curalin also support healthy blood sugar, which reinforces your joint health! </p>
